<h1>Tracking investments into the Peacebuilding and Statebuilding Goals</h1>
 
<aside></aside>
 
<p>This sankey diagram visualizes in detail how expenditures directed towards the New Deal's <a href="https://www.newdeal4peace.org/peacebuilding-and-statebuilding-goals/">Peacebuilding and Statebuilding Goals</a> (PSG 1-5) can be measured using the OECD's <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CRS1">ODA Data</a>. The chords connect the goals with the respective <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/purposecodessectorclassification.htm">purpose codes</a> of the OECD <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/dacandcrscodelists.htm">Creditor Reporting System</a>. The matching is based on the States of <a href="http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/development/states-of-fragility-2015_9789264227699-en#.WbUwltMjGu4">Fragility Report 2015</a>.</p>
